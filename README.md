# TodoMVC Redux Undo

## About
This is an implementation of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux), and [Redux Undo](https://github.com/omnidan/redux-undo).  It allows you to set the application state forward or backward in time based on the version of the current state.

The base TodoMVC implementation comes from the redux examples [Here](https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc).  The version control functionality was then added in addition.

## Running
